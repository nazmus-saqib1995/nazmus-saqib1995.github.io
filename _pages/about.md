I am a full-time researcher at the Intelligent Computing Lab, Jeju National University, South Korea, under the supervision of Professor Joon-Min Gil, where I focus on advanced topics in artificial intelligence and computer vision. In parallel, I serve as a part-time researcher at the Computer Vision Lab, University of Vaasa, Finland, working under the guidance of Professor Jani Bouttelier. I earned my Masterâ€™s degree in Computer Engineering from Chosun University, South Korea, where I was advised by Professor Ho Yub Jung. My research interests lie at the intersection of image inverse problems and diffusion-based generative modeling, with applications spanning image and video generation, translation, and restoration. My ongoing work is driven by the goal of developing robust and efficient deep learning models that advance the state-of-the-art in visual understanding and synthesis.
