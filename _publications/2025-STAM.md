title: "STAM: Zero-shot Style Transfer using Diffusion Model via Attention Modulation"
collection: publications 
permalink: /publication/2022-STAM
excerpt: Diffusion models serve as the basis of several different zero-shot image editing applications, including image
generation and style transfer. The basic approach in style
transfer using diffusion models involves swapping attention components between the provided content and style
images. Straightforward interchange of these components
can lead to inadequate style injection or loss of content
image characteristics. This paper addresses shortcomings
of attention-guided style transfer by two novel contributions. a) preserving content via dual path attention aggregation and b) maintaining the impact of style through
modulation of attention components. The proposed STAM
approach can provide aesthetically appealing yet contentpreserving style transfer through a combination of these
contributions and is also applicable to prompt-driven style
transfer. STAM is validated by extensive qualitative and quantitative evaluations and compared to ten recent works
that are largely outperformed by the proposed work. In addition to style transfer quality, STAM is also compared to
previous work in terms of inference time and remains close
to the fastest competing approaches. You will find this here. https://stam-zero.github.io/.
