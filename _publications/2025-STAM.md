title: "STAM: Zero-shot Style Transfer using Diffusion Model via Attention Modulation"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2022-STAM
excerpt: |
  Diffusion models serve as the basis of several different zero-shot image editing applications, including image generation and style transfer. The basic approach in style transfer using diffusion models involves swapping attention components between the provided content and style images.

  This paper addresses shortcomings of attention-guided style transfer by two novel contributions:
  (a) preserving content via dual path attention aggregation, and
  (b) modulation of attention components.

  The proposed STAM approach can provide aesthetically appealing yet content-preserving style transfer through a combination of these contributions.
